2023-SE-02_Lab_Task_11_DIP

"Create a Python program for LAB 11 – Morphological Operations using OpenCV. The program should allow the user to upload an image in Google Colab, automatically convert it to binary if it is grayscale, and perform the following tasks:
Perform erosion, dilation, opening, and closing with a configurable kernel size.
Extract boundaries using erosion.
Fill holes using morphological reconstruction.
Remove noise using morphological opening.
Detect shapes (triangles, rectangles, circles, unknown) and label them on the image.
Display all intermediate and final results in a 3x3 grid with titles.
The code should be modular, using separate functions for each operation, handle non-binary images, and have clear visualizations with proper colormaps. Ensure compatibility with Google Colab file upload."*
